 Homework Assignment 4
     I thought this week's problems were not too difficult however they took a long time due
     to the detail and the greater complexity of loops and using methods. The hardest problem
     for me was Inspid and Squareroot. Inspid I had an issue with methods not returning what they
     were supposed to, and squareroot I had issues with cutting off the next number when the preceeding
     two square root calculations matched up to four decimal places. Methods are not too bad, but I get 
     annoyed that a method can only return one value.
