 Homework Assignment 2
     I thought this week's problems were not too difficult. 
    The concepts of switch statements and repetition are not too difficult.
    The hardest thing I thought would be when to put a ";" after a while loop to
    indicate that the while loop was done executing what I wanted it to.
    The amicable numbers problem was probably the hardest because I kept 
     getting stuck in a repeating loop. But once i fixed my loops into the form
     of a "do while" loop things made more sense in my head and was able to 
     figure out why the loop was not quitting to go to the next loop. The 
     homework only took a few hours  to do, probably about 5 hours done 
     through out the week.
