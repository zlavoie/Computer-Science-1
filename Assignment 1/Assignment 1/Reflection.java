   9/12/2016 Assignment 1
   //The class is going well, nothing in the lectures is too complex. 
   // Taking How Computers Work last semester and AP Computer Science in high school  
    //really covered a lot of what we are going over. The homework probably took 3-4 hours.
    //The hardest problem was probably the monkey problem, with all the lines of code,
    //most of the problem was little errors here or there.
